## üîß Provider Setup  

To begin using the provider, you'll need a valid **API token** from your Valohai account.  
You can generate this token in your **Account Settings** in Valohai.  

![Get your Valohai API token](https://help.valohai.com/hc/article_attachments/4419921059345/get_auth_token.gif)  

**Example configuration:**  

```hcl
provider "valohai" {
  token = "<your_valohai_token>"
}
```

If no token is defined in the provider block, the provider will automatically check for the environment variable `VALOHAI_API_TOKEN`:

```bash
export VALOHAI_API_TOKEN="<your_valohai_token>"
```
